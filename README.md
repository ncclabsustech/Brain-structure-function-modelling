Tutorial on Neuroimaging Methods Workshop

We will cover the following tutorials:

1. The steps to generate the structural connectome from mrtrix3

2. The steps to generate functional time series from nilearn.

3. The python implemenation of the partial least square analysis of structural connectome and functional connectivity.

4. The python implemenation of the structural decoupling index.
[Ref] Preti, Maria Giulia, and Dimitri Van De Ville. "Decoupling of brain function from structure reveals regional behavioral specialization in humans." Nature communications 10.1 (2019): 1-7.

5. An example of the numerical optimization in pytorch

6. Fusion modeling of brain structure and functional dynamics. [The code will be uploaded soon!]
