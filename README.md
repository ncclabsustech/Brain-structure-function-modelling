# NM_workshop
Tutorial on Neuroimaging Methods Workshop

We will cover the following tutorials:

The steps to generate the structural connectome from mrtrix3. [The script of the whole process is uploaded.]

The steps to generate functional time series from nilearn.

The python implementation of the partial least square analysis of structural connectome and functional connectivity. [Ref] Mišić, Bratislav, et al. "Network-level structure-function relationships in human neocortex." Cerebral Cortex 26.7 (2016): 3285-3296.

The python implementation of the structural decoupling index. [Ref] Preti, Maria Giulia, and Dimitri Van De Ville. "Decoupling of brain function from structure reveals regional behavioral specialization in humans." Nature communications 10.1 (2019): 1-7.

An example of the numerical optimization in PyTorch

Fusion modeling of brain structure and functional dynamics. [The code will be uploaded soon!]

Note: 

The data (Structural Connectome and Functional Time series) we generated in the AAL atlas can be downloaded at this link:
