# Brain structure-function modelling (DTI and fMRI).
Tutorials on Neuroimaging Methods Workshop, CityU HK, 2022 

We cover the following tutorials:

1. The steps to generate the structural connectome from mrtrix3. [The script of the whole process is uploaded.]

2. The steps to generate functional time series from nilearn.

3. The python implementation of the partial least square analysis of structural connectome and functional connectivity.

4. The python implementation of the structural decoupling index. 

[Ref] Preti, Maria Giulia, and Dimitri Van De Ville. "Decoupling of brain function from structure reveals regional behavioral specialization in humans." Nature communications 10.1 (2019): 1-7.

5. An example of the numerical optimization in PyTorch

6. Fusion modeling of brain structure and functional dynamics. [The code will be uploaded soon!]

Note: 

The data (Structural Connectome and Functional Time series) we generated in the AAL atlas can be downloaded at this link:
